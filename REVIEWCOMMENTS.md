# Code Review 1

* Make sure users can log in and sign up and logout
* Think about the Cart model
  * Unauthenticated users should be able to check out
  * Authenticated users should be able to revisit their cart on a different device
* Travis is case-sensitive (solved by ignoring 🤷‍♀️)
* Search bar feel free to load all products into client state.
  * Throttling and pagination are bonus features, if you get to them
